Working with Github: Simple to do list project

Questions:

1)The .git folder contains all the information needed to track the codebase changes. In other words, the project's
version control (commits, remote repo address etc.) is handled using this file.
For .git to be built, a new repo should be created and to the git "git init" command is the proper way to build a new repo.

2)When you have the approach of atomic committing in a project, the commits should be as small as possible and so, each
commit does one, and only one simple thing that can be summed up in a simple sentence.
The same work for pull-request. When you are working on a fork of somebody else's project, the requests made during this
process should be as same as the commits in atomic commit.

3)All following commands, manage and manipulate the commit history on a git repo.

Fetch:
Is the action of getting updates from a remote repo to your local, without immediately applying them. It kind of works
as a mailbox.

Pull:
Is the action of getting updates from a remote repo and immediately automatically applying them. It kind of works as a
mailbox being checked and its letters read right away.

Merge:
Is the action of combining two different recipes into one. It kind of combines both local and upcoming changes and mixes
these different changes together.

Rebase:
Is the action of moving or reorganizing the sequence of commits in a project which is useful for making the commit history
easier to follow. It kind of like the action of rewriting the history of a novel.

Cherry-pick:
Is the action of selecting specific commits from one branch and apply them to another branch without merging or 
reorganizing the entire tree. It kind of represents a unique fruit you select and add to a fruit basket.
